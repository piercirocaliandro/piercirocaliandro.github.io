            I am a computer engineer born and raised in Roma Tor Vergata.<br>
            During my academic path, I studied different topics, such as:
            <ul>
                <li>Linux kernel</li>
                <li>Backend programming</li>
                <li>Cybersecurity, in particular network and information security, secure protocol design, malware analysis, penetration testing</li>
            </ul>  
            Passionate about everything that has a CLI version (I am not really into frontend or GUI).<br>
            I truly believe in open source and free access to knowledge resources as something that can have a strong impact on the world and can inspire more and more people.
