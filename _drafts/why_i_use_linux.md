# Why I use Linux (and why you shouldn't)

It's been 5 years since I decided to use a GNU/Linux (so that no one gets upset for naming convetions :P) distribution as my everyday OS.
The reason why I did this choice was primarly curiosity: as a Computer Engineering student, I heared a lot of people talking about how wonderful Linux was, compared to every else OS out there.
So, I decided to give it a shot: the first time I installed a Linux distro, it was Fedora, as suggested by one of my friends who helped me in installing and configuring it.
I suddenly repnted of my choice, as I found a lot of difficoulties when trying to install new software...
But I didn't give up: I switched to another distro, more intuitive and Windows-like, that is Linux Mint: I was able to get eveything I needed in place, and used it for like 2 years or so.

## Problems one can encounter: proprietary drivers
One of the biggest problems I have ever encountered was related to my Wi-Fi card driver: I was (and I am) still using an HP laptop, which driver was included into the mainline of some well known distros.
I tired them all, but I still encountered the same problem ever and ever again: suddenly, out of nowhere, my laptop would freeze, and I could not be able to resume it in any way.
Eventually I found out that there was an open source (God bless OS movement) driver that had been developed specifically for my HP model and a bunch of others, so I figured out how to black list the default driver and install that.
Now, seems that the default driver issues has been fixed, and I can use it, but I carried this problem with me for a long time.

## So am I happy with Tux right now? Yes.
Even if I listed a bunch of problems, right now I an very happy that I switched permanently to Linux for work / free time.
Then, why I think that you should not do the same. Was I paid by comptetitors (:O).
No, it's just that you should use what you believe is suitable for your needs.
A point that is usually made by someone who tries to convince another one to switch to Linux relates to software development: I am sure that you have that one friend/colleague who bullies you because you don't use Linux for programming (I am one of them (°)\_(°)).
But, seriously, you shouldn't mind this anti-advise, and instead use what you consider is the best for you.
It can alsa depend on sue cases: for example, during my Master's degree I had to do a project for distributed system course, with one of my friends we built this distributed key-value datastore (store-edge [link]).
We containerized the application and wanted to test it locally: we set up `docker compose` and needed to ping containers from the "outside" network.
Well, while this was trivial on Linux, on Windows (as my friend run it) it was nearly impossibile to do that, and we couldn't find any advice on the Internet.
That said, I think that you should decide to switch to Linux because you really want it, and not because 'cool people' use it: learning new things always leads to a uphill path, but even if the learning curve can be steep, the steeper it is, the more statisfaction you will achieve as a reward for your effort.
